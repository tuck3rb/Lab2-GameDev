Name: Garbage Man for my Roommate

Intent: To entertain with a quirky story and to have a speed runable max score

Narrative Structure: The main character, Tucker, has a messy roommate, Mark. Tucker is always having to pick up Mark's trash as he cannot stand dirty rooms. Infact, Tucker has the dream of one day owning a garbage truck with a parrot as a companion. Help Tucker clean up all of Mark's trash and then throw it away into the fireplace. 

Mechanics: Walking around a house with WASD or arrow keys. Clicking on a fireplace. Using a key input to pick up trash.

Aesthetics: Using a tilemap and characters to make the game feel prettier. There are appropiate sound effects and neat particle animations. Having the camera follow the player.

Joys: Coming up with the idea and experimenting with new unity elements. It was really fun to make progress and see a pretty game come together.

Struggles: We had to completely restart after making decent progress due to not figuring out how to overcome a merge conflict. It was also tought to get the pixels to look correct and adding a way to reset our game.

Contributions:
Both Mark and Tucker contributed equally. We both worked in the planning stages of what we wanted our project to look like. Both members worked on parts we agreed to work on before hand. Communication was really solid as we teams messaged a lot. We worked through merge conflicts and having to restart our game. Tucker set up the repositories and created tilemaps and aesthetics. Mark worked on creating scripts and assigning scripts to sprites. We worked together on Tuesday for 4 hours trying to complete our game. We were unsuccessful, but we persevered and kept working the next day.
